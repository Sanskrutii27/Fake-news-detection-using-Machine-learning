# Fake-news-detection-using-Machine-learning
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can identify fake news articles with high accuracy. With the increasing amount of news available on the internet, it has become easier for misinformation to spread quickly, making it difficult for people to distinguish between real and fake news.
To accomplish this goal, we will be using a dataset of news articles labeled as either real or fake to train our machine learning model. We will explore different natural language processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and machine learning algorithms to build a robust model that can effectively classify news articles as real or fake.
Once the model is trained, we will evaluate its performance using various metrics and test it on a new set of news articles to ensure that it is accurate and reliable. We will also provide a user interface to enable users to input news articles and receive feedback on whether the article is likely to be fake or not.
The project will provide an efficient solution to detect fake news and reduce the spread of misinformation, which can have significant consequences on individuals and society as a whole.
